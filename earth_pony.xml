			<p><b>Ability Score Increase</b></p>
			<p>Your Constitution increases by 2. Your Strength increases by 1.</p>
			<p><b>Age</b></p>
			<p>Ponies in Equestria have a similar lifespan to humans in our world. A pony reaches maturity around 18 years old, while an 80 year old pony is nearing the end of its life. Alicorns are an exception, as they do not age.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment</b></p>
			<p>Most ponies are Good at heart, erring towards love and acceptance rather than hate. Though some may lose their way, redemption is never impossible for most. As with every group of complex people, there are sometimes exceptions to this.</p>
			<p><b>Size</b></p>
			<p>Most ponies are around 3-4 feet tall. Earth Ponies are the hardiest, averaging around 400-450 pounds. Your size is Small.</p>
			<p><b>Speed</b></p>
			<p>Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
			<p><b>Languages</b></p>
			<p>You can speak, read, and write Pony.</p>
			<p><b>Hooves</b></p>
			<p>Your hooves are natural weapons. If you strike with them, you deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6+ your Strength modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Flexibility</b></p>
			<p>Lacking wings or magic to get things done, the Earth Ponies of Equestria have learned to adapt to their environment in many creative ways. You may take a free Feat.</p>
